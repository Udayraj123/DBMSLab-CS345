Above are exactly the Intersection of Elective courses in Insitute.pdf and those mentioned by depts (EE,CE and PH) in their own timetable. Hence these need to be removed from one of the places, prefererring Institute one as it's easier (added count checks too).
CSE has mentioned too, but they have only one intersection CS526 which was removed from dept csv coz of venue conflict.

CH643 had "same venue as" CH438 - 4005 : manually added
