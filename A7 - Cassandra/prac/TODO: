	algo: (assumption(true)-files are consecutive in dates)
	sort expanded_records by date, hashtag
	for each day, count num occurences for each value and store it in separate df- accum_sum
	now in that df, move a N-wide sliding window on columns
	>Then store the day, (top 20) hashtags, count entries (113 * 200K+)
