MySQL vs Cassandra
> The rows and columns in NoSQLDBs are (kinda) interchanged!
> In a crude manner, In MySQL you create and display data when requested, In Cassandra you write expected queries beforehand and then simply display them when requested.

Column
Each column is an entry in the cassandra records.
Furthermore, Cassandra defines the concept of Super Columns. Super Columns are columns that themselves consist of a set of columns. A column can also have a Time-To-Live (TTL). After the TTL has expired the entry is deleted asynchronously.


Column Family (or Table)
A column family is a set of rows. Each column family must define a primary key that can consist of a single column or of a composite of multiple columns. The primary key is used to determine the storage location for the row. The columns of a row are never split across several Casandra nodes.

Row
A row is an ordered set of columns.


When data is inserted into the cluster, the first step is to apply a hash function to the partition key. The output is used to determine what node (and replicas) will get the data. Cassandra utilizes Murmur3 to create a consistent token value. That token value will be inside the range of tokens owned by single node.
	>> A partition key controls data locality, it’s probably best to not use just one

	Since using a JOIN isn’t possible with Cassandra, we have much less complexity creating data 
	models. The complexity trade-off for Apache Cassandra is in knowing about your queries and data 
	access patterns ahead of time. 
	
	-- Partition key(aka Super Column key) should be uniformly distributed in its domain 
	(Nope, there are many other tables that have to be modified by the same inserts, so overall the nodes won't be inactive- Cannot be date, else each day only one node will be active for inserts)
	Candidates in our case are: 
		author_id(in large scales)(It's a group of tweets that can be frequently queried together), 
		tweet_date (For non-live data, OR COMBINE IT WITH OTHER CANDIDATES WHICH'D MAKE IT THE BEST ONE)
		tid (in small scales)(As it evenly spreads),
		location* (but it is Nullable, hence not valid)

^^ similar thoughts are reflected in discussion here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37512446/cassandra-data-modeling-for-a-social-network

(First Iteration)With single table: (tweet_date, author_id, like_count, tweet_datetime, tid) as:
	1 is a full cluster scan always as it needs tweets for all days,
	2,3,4 are full cluster scans always as partitioning by hashtags, keywords or mention_list won't narrow down no of nodes to search in, The ordering is handled by tweet_datetime, like_count.	
	6 is full table coz location can be Null, hence not a key.
	5,7,8 read/delete queries will be only one-node focused, hence optimal.

Conclusion: This can be made much better if we make a separate table for each type of queries
> But for like 3, keeping full tweet data with the hashtag isnt a wise choice. It's too much of duplicate data to deal with. Making hashtag a partition key and tids with it will do. Better to read through all nodes.

( Cassandra  is a NoSQL database that essentially only supports Key-Value access), 

Separate table for popular hashtags,


??	-- How to ensure tid stays unique??
??  -- What if mentioned author changes username(what'd twitter do)
	Remember, the usual values of LIMIT directive in the query would be small i.e. still the no of partitions looked up will be less.

	-- Clustering key is the per-cluster index for ordering inside the physical node.
	Candidates in our case are: tid, tweet_date, tweet_datetime<<,

Rule 1: Spread Data Evenly Around the Cluster  <-
Rule 2: Minimize the Number of Partitions Read <-
***Remember, data duplication is okay. Many of your tables may repeat the same data.
You will use roughly one table per query pattern. If you need to support multiple query patterns, you usually need more than one table.

ORDER BY clauses can select a single column only. That column has to be the second column in a compound PRIMARY KEY. This also applies to tables with more than two column components in the primary key.

 "Data in Cassandra is often arranged as one query per table, and data is repeated amongst many tables, a process known as denormalization. Relational databases instead normalize data, removing as much duplication as possible. The relationship of the entities is important, because the order in which data is stored in Cassandra can greatly affect the ease and speed of data retrieval. The schema design captures much of the relationship between entities by including related attributes in the same table. Client-side joins in application code is used only when table schema cannot capture the complexity of the relationships."

 "In this day and age disk is WAY cheaper than it used to be. That being said, I understand that it isn't always easy to just throw more disk at a problem. The bigger problem I see is adjusting the DAO layer of your application to keep 10 tables in-sync"


 Note: A WHERE clause can be used only on the columns that are a part of primary key or have a secondary index on them.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35708118/where-and-order-by-clauses-in-cassandra-cql
 In CQL, the ORDER BY clause is really only used to reverse the defined sort direction of your clustering order. As for the columns themselves, you can only specify the columns defined (and in that exact order...no skipping) in your CLUSTERING ORDER BY clause at table creation time. So you cannot pick arbitrary columns to order your result set at query-time.

The ALLOW FILTERING means Cassandra is reading through all your data, but only returning data within the range specified. This is only efficient if the range is most of the data. If you wanted to find records within e.g. a 5 minute time window, this would be very inefficient.

MY (BIASED) THOUGHTS-
Cassandra is all about Pre-calculation. About how you can fit user inputs into one of the prepared statements and design your tables accordingly for that.
