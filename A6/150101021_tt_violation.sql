/*
M2) PREGENERATE IN TEMP TABLE -
There are 329 course_id entries in ett. => 329C2 =  53956 pregenerated pairs with a yes/no column stating their overlap
	Generating them in order will save calculations
	But as there arre ~4000 students each with avg 6C2=15 pairs = 60000 pairs, thus it has more calculations and it is unordered as well.

Also, it is better to loop cursor on each course and list out the roll numbers in it, 
and it will be easier to use two pointers in it.
We can make use of lexical order

Yup-
1. Create temp table (outside or inside?) ett_clash
2. for each course course1:
	for each course course2 ahead of course1: (declare cursor inside of the loop)
		if(checkOverlap(course1,course2))
			load roll_number,name in the courses course1 and course2 and print the clash lines 

Nope- Bruteforce -
1. Use cursor to iterate through students table and another for ett table
2. for each student : 
		load their course list from cwls
		for each pair of courses list:
			call checkForOverlap(course1,course2) which will print if clash exists
.
